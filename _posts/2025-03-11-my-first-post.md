# My First Post

This is my first post on my new (and only) blog. I wonder if people these days care much for blogs, with the advent of square shaped pictures on a screen, short snippets of text, or dare I say e-books. I also wonder who will stumble apon this and think this is even worthwhile reading, in a day and age of hyper-productivity and the commodification of time. Anyway, I digress. The main reasons for starting this blog revolves around three central tenets: to develop my own understanding and learning, to share things that interest me, to open potential opportunities for collaboration with interested and interesting people.

To elaborate further - I often have many ideas, thoughts, observations floating through my head, and I often think it would be great to expand them into something more substantial. Hopefully this platform gives me the motivation to consolidate my thoughts into short, medium and long digestable chunks - not only to think a bit deeper, but to share things that others might find interesting. In a world where media consumpation is increasingly characterised by short attention spans I feel it's all the more important to encourage deeper engagement with the world, whether that be through words, stories, experience, living. This is one aspect where I hope to contribute in this way.

Expect topics related to technology, science, climate change, bouldering, music, mathematics, life, conciousness, philosophy, relationships among many others that I can't think of right now. Don't hold me to that though. I'm sure there will be some funny stories thrown in there too. If you like what I end up writing about in the blog section (or any section of this ever evolving website), please feel free to reach out in the contact section.

Well, I better get on with it...
